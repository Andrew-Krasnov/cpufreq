### How-to disable  Intel pstate driver
(default for Intel Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge CPUs on kernel 3.9 and upper)
To change back to the ACPI driver, reboot and add to the kernel line `intel_pstate=disable`
Then execute modprobe acpi-cpufreq and you should have the ondemand governor available.

You can make the changes permanent by editing /etc/default/grub and adding
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="intel_pstate=disable"
```
Then update grub.cfg
```
sudo update-grub
or
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
Follow [the instructions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling) for Arch kernel module loading and add the acpi-cpufreq module.
