# Contributions

There are tons of ways to contribute to the project. The easiest thing to do to keep going projects: _Leave response, give some feedback to the authors_. If you like it or not let's authors to know about you and your needs. But you should keep it constructive, especially, for negative comments to point some issues with it.

**"Like"**, **"Star"**, **"Thumb"**, **"Post"**, **"Share"**, **"Comment" it!** Be involved. Don't be pathetic. The thing is the authors are people just like you. Any feedback helps authors to understand that people don't uncaring about their children or beloved pets. It could make great job to boost faster growing communities around the projects and keeping them alive so.
