It was a big surprise when I listened [LINUX Unplugged show](https://linuxunplugged.com/317?t=2034) by [Jupiter Broadcasting ](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/) and Chris started to talk about **CPUFreq Extension** for GNOME DE. It was nice to hear that Chris Fisher found us. I think we should thank to [Level1Tech](https://www.level1techs.com/)'s Wendell Wilson for that.
