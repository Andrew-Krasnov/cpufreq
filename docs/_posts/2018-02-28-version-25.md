<img alt="" src="{{ "/assets/images/posts/power_events.png" | relative_url }}" align="right" style="margin:0 48px 12px 48px">

After 3 months of delay, today released a 'new' version of cpufreq extension on Gnome.

**History of changes**
1. The optimized work of the garbage collector to improve a memory usage.
2. An ability to assign custom user profiles to charging and discharging events in the preferences window. We don't have enough of testing reports yet. If you have issues with this feature, please report it [here](https://github.com/konkor/cpufreq/issues/33) in any case.

_I hope the new version I will push very soon to bring support for upcoming Gnome 3.28 release._
